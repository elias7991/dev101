# Todo App

This is a Flutter project that utilizes [FVM](https://fvm.app/) to manage Flutter versions. Make sure to have FVM installed to facilitate the management of Flutter versions in your development environment.
**Obs.: If you don't want to use fvm you must have version 3.22.1 of flutter which requires version 3.4.1 of dart**

## Prerequisites

- [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) (recommended through FVM)
- [FVM](https://fvm.app/documentation/getting-started/installation) installed on your machine

## Installing FVM

If you haven't installed FVM yet, you can do so using the following command:

```bash
choco install fvm
```
